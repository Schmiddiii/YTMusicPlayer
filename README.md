# YTMusicPlayer
A autonomous player with YouTube Music using Puppeteer and AutoHotkey

With this program you can control your YouTube Music Playlist with shortcuts. You can pause a song or skip it with any shortcut you want. It even skips ads automatically.

To start you should change the settings in settings.json. You can change the port and change the URL to your YTMusic playlists. When the playlist is private you need to set the cookies. To do that, you can use the Chrome-Extension [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg). You have to export cookies and paste them into the cookies-array.

To change the keybindings go into the AHKYTMusic.ahk file and change F18 and F19 to the shortcut you want according to the AutoHotkey syntax.
